# React Bricks Remix starter

Kick-start your project with this boilerplate for an empty Remix proje t based on [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com), with both the front-end and admin dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

We suggest that you use the CLI and choose this starter.  
In this way you will have the credentials already set up in your `.env` files and you may have some default content:

```bash
npx create-reactbricks-app
```

Otherwise you can directly clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reactbricks/remix-starter-reactbricks your-project
```
